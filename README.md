# Sense Hat on Raspberry Pi3/4

The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Early on, the Raspberry Pi project leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries

The Sense Hat is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi competition. The board allows you to make measurements of temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation (Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Magnetometer) and to output information using its built-in LED matrix.
